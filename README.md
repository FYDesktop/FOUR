##### Four  
--------
**[Website](https://www.freeyourdesktop.com/)**

A Linux Electron App to access the UK(Only) Channel 4 website. Channel 4 provide players for every other platform Win/Mac/Xbox/Android/IOS

Provides Live streams for:
- Channel 4
- E4
- More 4
- Film 4
- 4 Seven
- 4 Music

And access to catch-up services and channel 4 series boxsets.

## Features:
- Tray Icon with minimise to tray and application menu provided
- Context menu, with cut, copy, paste: (check inspect element in release)
- The player can be undocked from the main window (Not live streams) to make a seperate mini player. Menu selections from here close the player and open the selection in the main window 


Uses libpepflashplayer.so from chromeOS, taken from https://github.com/TomBZombie/Linux-Watch-Flash-DRM
This enables Linux to run flash DRM content (dirty hack, but the only way at the moment)

This is my first ever attempt at developing a full application (Small shell & python scripts excluded)

## Known Bugs

- On clicking play a notice sometimes appears about ad blockers, a 10 second countdown begins and then you have to click play again.
- On clicking flash fullscreen the player opens in it's own maximized window with a blank title bar. 4 Music live is the exception as it is served from another provider.
- When the Application start the channel4 homepage has a gap between the window menu and the webpage menu due to a full background advert which doesn't display,dissapears when switching pages.
- Flash player cannot be resized.

## Todo

- Check internet connectivity.
- Media Player Controls - (focus on flash tab keypress space then lose focus) accessability
- Mpris Intergration.
- Player Window resizing, title bar removal and fullscreen key control.
- Clean up Icons
- Add Description into package.json
- Package for appimage, deb, maybe snap.

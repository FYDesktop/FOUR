Four
--------

A Linux x64 Electron App to access the UK(Only) Channel 4 website. Channel 4 provide players for every other platform Win/Mac/Xbox/Android/IOS

Provides Live streams for:
* Channel 4
* E4
* More 4
* Film 4
* 4 Seven
* 4 Music

And access to catch-up services and channel 4 series boxsets.

Features:
---------
Tray Icon with minimise to tray and application menu provided
Context menu, with cut, copy, paste: (check inspect element in release)
The player can be undocked from the main window (Not live streams) to make a seperate mini player. Menu selections from here close the player and open the selection in the main window 


Uses libpepflashplayer.so from chromeOS, taken from https://github.com/TomBZombie/Linux-Watch-Flash-DRM
This enables Linux to run flash DRM content (dirty hack, but the only way at the moment)

This is my first ever attempt at developing a full application (Small shell & python scripts excluded)
